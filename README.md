# activity1-diabetes-prediction

##OBJECTIVE - The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes based on a given set of medical attributes.
The project will involve data preprocessing, feature engineering, and applying classification algorithms to the dataset. By the end of the project, the goal is to build a model that accurately classifies 
individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic and to evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
